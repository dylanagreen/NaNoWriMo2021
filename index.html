        This very hasitly and very badly constructed website is where I am posting
        my NaNoWriMo 2021 Novel, day by day. I am acutely aware that this site
        looks like it was written in 1995. Anyway, here is a vague summary of
        the novel:
        </p>

        <p>
          Harry Flynn has a problem. He can't see straight. People vanish from his
          sight, he mistakes a volunteer in his stage show for his ex-wife, and
          worst of all, he's suddenly inundated with memories of being a contract
          killer for a sprawling crime syndicate.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then, to top it all off, he can't remember his mysterious ex-wife
          even to the point of forgetting about her murder. There's only one
          way out: bring down the Syndicate before his mind completely falls
          apart.
