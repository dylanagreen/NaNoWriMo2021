        This very hasitly and very badly constructed website is where I am posting
        my NaNoWriMo 2021 Novel, day by day. I am acutely aware that this site
        looks like it was written in 1995. Anyway, here is a vague summary of
        the novel.

          Harry Flynn has a problem. He can't see straight. People vanish from his
          sight, he mistakes a volunteer in his stage show for his ex-wife, and
          worst of all, he's suddenly inundated with memories of being a contract
          killer for a sprawling crime syndicate. As the hours turn into days
          Harry starts to realize that his mind is starting to fall apart
          quicker than he can put it back together.

          And then, to top it all off, he can't remember his mysterious ex-wife
          even to the point of forgetting about her murder. Unfortunately for
          Harry he's left with only one
          way out: bring down the Syndicate, find who did this to him, and
          if lucky, catch his ex-wife's killer. And he has to do all of this
          before his mind completely falls apart.

          Generally I pick one word working titles for my novels while I write
          them and then pick a title when I'm done. To that end, the working
          title for this novel is <b>Psychic</b>. Below you will find links
          to each day's writing. Remember while you read that this writing is
          unedited, may be extremely messy, and may be riddled with plot holes.
          That's what makes it fun to read.

          You will also find a link to "The Story so Far" which includes every
          days writing on a single page. This is useful for those who want to read
          the entire story at once. On this page each day's writing alternates
          in font color, between black and navy blue.
